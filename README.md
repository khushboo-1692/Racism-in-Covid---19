# Racism-in-Covid---19

While a tragedy for everyone, COVID-19 has imposed disproportionate hardships on Afro-American population of the U.S. Death rates among African Americans has been quite higher compared to overall population.

When New York City produced its first racial breakdown of Covid-19 deaths in April it showed that Latino and black New Yorkers, especially in the outer boroughs including Queens and the Bronx, were experiencing death rates that were at least twice those of whites and Asians.

At this point we have to assume that the clear lack of guidance from the federal government is going to continue, and that states are going to have to do it for themselves.
